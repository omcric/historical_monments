<a name="Victoria Memorial"><h2><b>11. Victoria Memorial, Kolkata</b></h2>
<img border="4" src="Victoria_Memorial_situated_in_Kolkata.jpg" height=420 width=70%>
<p>Victoria Memorial is one of the famous and beautiful monuments of Kolkata. It was built between 1906 and 1921 to commemorate Queen Victoria's 25-year reign in India. After the Sepoy 
Mutiny of 1857, the British government gathered the reins of control of the country directly, and in 1876 the British parliament made Victoria the Empress of India. Her reign ended with 
her death in 1901. The Victoria Memorial is possibly the most awesome reminder of the Raj to be found in India. This huge white-marble museum, made from Makrana marbles from Rajasthan, 
is filled with a vast collection of remnants from the period of British Empire rule in India. The forms in the museum like the great dome, clustered with four subsidiary, octagonal domed 
chattris, the high portals, the terrace and the domed corner towers speak of a splendid richness in architecture.</p></a>
<a name="Qutub Minar"><h2><b>12. Qutub Minar, New Delhi</b></h2>
<img border="4" src="Qutub-Minar.jpg" height=630 width=37.5%>
<p>Built in the 13th century, the magnificent tower stands in the capital, Delhi. It has a diameter of 14.32m at the base and about 2.75m on the top with a height of 72.5m. It is an 
architectural marvel of ancient India. The complex has a number of other important monuments such as the gateway built in 1310, the Alai Darwaza, Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque; the tombs of 
Altamish, Ala-ud-din Khalji and Imam Zamin; the Alai Minar, a 7m high Iron Pillar, etc. Qutub-ud-Din Aibak of Slave Dynasty laid the foundation of Minar in A.D. 1199 to give calls for 
prayer and raised the first storey, to which were added three more storeys by his successor and son-in-law, Shams-ud-Din Itutmish (A.D. 1211-36). All the storeys are surrounded by a projected 
balcony encircling the minar and supported by stone brackets, which are decorated with honey-comb design, more conspicuously in the first storey.</p></a>
<a name="Jama Masjid"><h2><b>13. Jama Masjid, Old Delhi</b></h2>
<img border="4" src="Jama_Masjid_-_In_the_Noon.jpg" height=420 width=50%>
<p>Jama Masjid (the mosque of Friday), Delhi is the country's largest and perhaps its most magnificent mosque. It stands across the road from Red Fort. The great mosque of Old Delhi is 
the final architectural extravagance of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan with a courtyard capable of holding 25,000 devotees. The mosque measures 65m by 35m, and its court forms a square of 
100m. It's also known as 'Masjid-i-Jahanuma' or 'Mosque commanding view of the world'. It was designed as Emperor Shahjahan's principal mosque. Situated in the ancient town of Old Delhi, 
this monument was built by five thousand artisans. The structure was placed on a high platform so that its magnificent facade would be visible from all the adjoining areas.</p></a>
<a name="Jantar Mantar"><h2><b>14. Jantar Mantar, New Delhi</b></h2>
<img border="4" src="Jantar-Mantar.jpg" height=420 width=60%>
<p>The Jantar Mantar is an equinoctial sundial, consisting of a gigantic triangular gnomon with the hypotenuse parallel to the Earth's axis. On either side of the gnomon is a quadrant of 
a circle, parallel to the plane of the equator.<br> At first sight, the Jantar Mantar appears like a gallery of modern art. It is, however, an observatory. Sawai Jia Singh II of Jaipur 
(1699-1743), a keen astronomer and a noble in the Mughal court, was dissatisfied by the errors of brass and metal astronomical instruments. Under patronage from the emperor, he set on himself the task of correcting the existing 
astronomical tables and updating the almanac with more reliable instruments. Delhi's Jantar Mantar is the first of the five observatories that he built with large masonry instruments.</p></a>
<a name="Charminar"><h2><b>15. Charminar, Hyderabad</b></h2>
<img border="4" src="charminar-photos.jpg" height=630 width=37.5%>
<p>The Charminar is a massive arch built by Mohammed Quli Qutab Shah, in 1591 to commemorate the end of the plague in the city. The symbol of the city, the Charminar, is an impressive 
square monument with four minarets. The arch is illuminated daily in the evening, an unforgettable sight indeed.<br>
The monument is a magnificent square edifice of granite, built upon four grand arches facing North, South, East and West. These arches support two floors of rooms and gallery of archways. 
At each corner of the square structure is a minaret rising to a height of 24 meters, making the building nearly 54 meters tall. It is these four (char) minarets (minar) that give the 
building, its name 'Charminar'. Each minar stands on a lotus-leaf base, a special recurrent motif in Qutub Shahi buildings.</p></a><hr>
