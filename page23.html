<p><font size="+2">Jama Masjid (the mosque of Friday), Delhi is the country's largest and perhaps its most magnificent mosque. It stands across the road from Red Fort. The great mosque of Old Delhi is 
the final architectural extravagance of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan with a courtyard capable of holding 25,000 devotees. The mosque measures 65m by 35m, and its court forms a square of 
100m. It's also known as 'Masjid-i-Jahanuma' or 'Mosque commanding view of the world'. It was designed as Emperor Shahjahan's principal mosque. Situated in the ancient town of Old Delhi, 
this monument was built by five thousand artisans. The structure was placed on a high platform so that its magnificent facade would be visible from all the adjoining areas.</p>
