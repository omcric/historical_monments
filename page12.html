<p><font size="+2">The Golden Temple, also known as Harmandir Sahib or Darbar Sahib, is a Sikh Gurdwara located in the Amritsar, Punjab. Shri Darbar Sahibb is the holiest shrine and most famous pilgrimage place for Sikhs.
Harmandir Sahib is one of the most sacred places in India, a Holy Granth Sahib is always present inside the temple. The Harmandir Sahib is the focus of a complex of buildings that form 
the heart of Sikhism. The temple itself occupies a small island in the centre of the tank, or pool, called the Amrita Saras (“Pool of Nectar”)—the source of the city’s name—and is 
connected to land on its west side by a marble causeway running across the water of the pool.</p>
