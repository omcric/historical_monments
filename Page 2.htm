<img border="4" src="Gateway-of-India.jpg" height=420 width=50%>
<p>The Gateway of India, with its regal arches, stands guard facing the Arabian Sea at Apollo Bunder in bustling Colaba area of Mumbai. The most popular tourist attraction, it is the 
unofficial icon of the city of Mumbai and is a reminder of its rich colonial history as Bombay. The first structure to welcome visitors entering the city by sea, it is popularly called 
‘Taj Mahal of Mumbai’. It stands at the end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Marg at the water’s edge. The Gateway of India was built to celebrate and honor the visit of King George V and Queen 
Mary to India for their formal proclamation as Emperor and Empress of India at the Delhi Durbar in December 1911. Visited by tourists and locals alike, the gateway and its promenade 
affords a great view of the boat-studded sea and is the connecting point for boat rides to and from the famous Elephanta Caves.</p></a>

<img border="4" src="Buland Darwaza.jpg" height=420 width=40%>
<p>Buland Darwaza or the loft gateway at Fatehpur Sikri was built by the great Mughal emperor, Akbar in 1601. Akbar built the Buland Darwaza to commemorate his victory over Gujarat. 
The Buland Darwaza, approached by 42 steps and 53.63m high and 35 meters wide, is the highest gateway in the world and an astounding example of the Mughal architecture. It is made of red 
and buff sandstone, and decorated by carving and inlaying of white and black marble.<br>
The Buland Darwaza towers above the courtyard of the mosque. It is semi octagonal in plan and is topped by pillars and chhatris, echoing early Mughal design with simple ornamentation, 
carved verses from the Koran and towering arches.</p></a>

<img border="4" src="Meenakshi Temple.jpg" height=420 width=46%>
<p>The ancient city of Madurai, more than 2,500 years old, was built by the Pandyan king, Kulashekarar, in the 6th century B.C. But the reign of the Nayaks marks the golden period of 
Madurai when art, architecture and learning flourished expansively. The most beautiful buildings in the city including its most famous landmark, the Meenakshi temple, were built during 
the Nayak rule.<br>
Located in the heart of the city of Madurai, the Meenakshi-Sundareshwarar temple is dedicated to goddess Meenakshi, the consort of lord Shiva. It has long been the focus of both Indian 
and international tourist attraction as well as one of the most important places of Hindu pilgrimage. For the people of Madurai, the temple is the very center of their cultural and 
religious life. It is said that the people of the city wake up, not by the call of nature but by the chant of hymns at the temple. All the major festivals of Tamil Nadu are celebrated here.</p></a>
<a name="Sanchi Stupa"><h2><b>9. Sanchi Stupa, Sanchi</b></h2>
<img border="4" src="Sanchi-Stupa1.jpg" height=420 width=50%>
<p>The Great Stupa at Sanchi is one of the most important Buddhist monuments reflecting gem of Buddhist art and architecture. Located at Sanchi Town, Madhya Pradesh, India, this Stupa is 
the oldest stone structure in India that was built during the Mauryan period. Originally commissioned in the third century BCE by Emperor Ashok this huge hemispherical dome with a height 
of 12.2816.46 m (54.0 ft) consists of a central chamber where the relics of Lord Buddha are placed. Enlisted as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1989, it is counted among the best 
conserved ancient Stupas of central India. This fascinating and world famous Stupa and other structures in Sanchi portraying brilliance of Buddhist art and sculpture attract attention 
of thousands of visitors round the year including national and foreign tourists, archaeologists and historians among others. The site remains open from sunrise to sunset.</p></a>
<a name="Purana Qila"><h2><b>10. Purana Qila, New Delhi</b></h2>
<img border="4" src="Purana-Qila_600-1280x720.jpg" height=420 width=50%>
<p>Purana Quila in Delhi has been built on a small hill standing on the banks of river Yamuna with its massive rubble wall and imposing gateway houses. The structure houses a mosque, 
which has a double storied octagonal tower. According to Hindu literature the fort marks the site of Indraprastha, the magnificent capital of the Pandavas, though the construction was 
carried out by a Afgan ruler Sher Shah Suri any time between 1538 to 1545 in the 3rd century who wrested the throne of Delhi from the Mughal emperor Humayun. It is said that the Mughal 
king Humayun fell from tower accidentally and died. The walls of the Qila, and the few structures within – a stepwell, a squat tower used as a library-cum-observatory, and a fine 
mosque – are attributed to the Mughal emperor Humayun and the Afghan Sher Shah Suri (‘The Lion King’), rivals who ruled Delhi in the mid-16th century.</p></a><hr>
