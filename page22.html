<p><font size="+2">Built in the 13th century, the magnificent tower stands in the capital, Delhi. It has a diameter of 14.32m at the base and about 2.75m on the top with a height of 72.5m. It is an 
architectural marvel of ancient India. The complex has a number of other important monuments such as the gateway built in 1310, the Alai Darwaza, Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque; the tombs of 
Altamish, Ala-ud-din Khalji and Imam Zamin; the Alai Minar, a 7m high Iron Pillar, etc. Qutub-ud-Din Aibak of Slave Dynasty laid the foundation of Minar in A.D. 1199 to give calls for 
prayer and raised the first storey, to which were added three more storeys by his successor and son-in-law, Shams-ud-Din Itutmish (A.D. 1211-36). All the storeys are surrounded by a projected 
balcony encircling the minar and supported by stone brackets, which are decorated with honey-comb design, more conspicuously in the first storey.</p>
