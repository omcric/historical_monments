<p><font size="+2">The Gateway of India, with its regal arches, stands guard facing the Arabian Sea at Apollo Bunder in bustling Colaba area of Mumbai. The most popular tourist attraction, it is the 
unofficial icon of the city of Mumbai and is a reminder of its rich colonial history as Bombay. The first structure to welcome visitors entering the city by sea, it is popularly called 
‘Taj Mahal of Mumbai’. It stands at the end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Marg at the water’s edge. The Gateway of India was built to celebrate and honor the visit of King George V and Queen 
Mary to India for their formal proclamation as Emperor and Empress of India at the Delhi Durbar in December 1911. Visited by tourists and locals alike, the gateway and its promenade 
affords a great view of the boat-studded sea and is the connecting point for boat rides to and from the famous Elephanta Caves.</p>
